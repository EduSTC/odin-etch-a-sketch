# Self-Reflection
Before starting I thought it would be very though but with the hint of using multiple divs everything came smoothly, I needed to search a lot offcourse but I could break the problem in multiple parts and search each one of them until it was done.

# What to Improve
I'm waiting the course to teach about the semantic HTML but I know I will need to learn it cause my code is small and is already using a lot of divs making it dirty, also I need to keep my javascript code more clean, some methods can be refactored to be used in multiple places and I don't know how to solve yet but I'm sure I'm using more global code than I should. In CSS there's a bug that I can't make the hover effect work after erase the squares but with !important it works fine and I shouldn't be relying on it yet so someday I will come again and correct this. Forgot to using branches too...

# Other bugs
I couldn't figure out how to make the icon go in front of the input color and have the same animation as a button. I tried putting it inside a label but it didn't animate and the icon became slighest crooked.
